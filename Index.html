<h1> Wealthy Cities In The World </h1>    
<p>According to the United Nations’ latest report on populations in cities, by 2030, “urban areas are projected to house 60 percent of people globally and one in every three people will live in cities with at least half a million inhabitants”. </p>
Growing in both size and number, cities are hubs of government, commerce, and transportation, and in 2021, the world’s 20 largest cities are home to half a billion people. </br>
 In fact, one in five people worldwide lives in a city with more than 1 million inhabitants.</p>
