<p>Tokyo, Japanâ€™s busy capital, mixes the ultramodern and the traditional, from neon-lit skyscrapers to historic temples. 
</br> The opulent Meiji Shinto Shrine is known for its towering gate and surrounding woods. 
</br> The Imperial Palace sits amid large public gardens. 
</br>The city's many museums offer exhibits ranging from classical art (in the Tokyo National Museum) to a reconstructed kabuki theater (in the Edo-Tokyo Museum).</p>
